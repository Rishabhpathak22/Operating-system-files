# Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming Projects

This repository contains various projects related to operating systems and concurrent programming. Each project focuses on different aspects of operating system concepts, CPU scheduling algorithms, and synchronization problems.

## Projects Overview

1. **FCFS program**: Implementation of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm.
2. **Round_Robin**: Implementation of the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
3. **Sleeping_barber_problem**: Implementation of the Sleeping Barber Problem, a classic synchronization problem in concurrent programming.
4. **Dining Philosopher Problem using Semaphores**: Implementation of the Dining Philosophers Problem using semaphores for synchronization.
5. **Priority scheduling**: Implementation of the Priority Scheduling CPU scheduling algorithm.
6. **Shortest Job First**: Implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm.
7. **threads.c**: Contains implementations of multi-threaded programs using pthreads or a similar threading library.
